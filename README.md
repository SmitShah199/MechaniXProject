# Project Idea:
As a group, we planned to create a web-based platform which will help users/customers to find artists (specifically with a similar Genre, Artist) according to their personal interests and preference rather than just their listening history.

# Project background/Business Opportunity:

Music play a vital role in human life. When it comes to past ceremonial music to this ages’ Hip-hop beats; music is one of many ways people express their feelings. Listening to music relaxes, satisfies the mind, and much more. To help all these people enjoy the music according to their preferred genre and artist, rather than being restricted to a streaming platforms’ algorithm. We, as a group are planning to create software that will understand the user's interest and provide 'only' similar music. It would find music based on the interest of the users, by every search or click the software will better understand and store the user's preferences. Therefore it becomes a very personalized software that gives recommendation for a specific music taste, while also being open to user’s willingness to explore.

This can be a business opportunity as these problems exist with some popular music apps like Spotify, etc. Spotify can be irritating sometimes with how its algorithms hops between the different genres of music. I believe this problem is very common for Spotify users and so this platform can be a blessing to many music lovers. (Hopefully) Solving a problem faced by many users can attract and increase the usage of this web-based software and hence there is a high chance of business opportunity.
